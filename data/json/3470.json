His impending absence strains his already nearly wordless relationship with Liliana, his fianc\u00e9e. They meet regularly at a dance hall and sometimes go riding on his motorcycle. We watch him arrive in Sicily, walk the town, live in a hotel, find lodgings, work, and participate in local events. It's a solitary, melancholy life. In his mind's eye he thinks about Liliana. He hasn't been entirely faithful. There's pain and detachment in her eyes. Across this distance, can anything bring about a breakthrough? Do they have a future?", "Language": "Italian", "Country": "Italy", "Awards": "1 win & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWYxYmI4YWQtMWU0MC00NzIwLWE2YjctOTAzNGFjMDk2ODkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIwNDY4NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.6", "imdbVotes": "1,643", "imdbID": "tt0055981", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "24 Jun 2003", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Criterion Collection", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.6/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "100%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
