Alex is a card shark with a big dream to go out to the world and leave his own mark. His determination leads him to break up with his girl friend, Lise (Julie Deply). Alex initially refuses to help Marc and Hans for their \"job\" of stealing the culture of new drug. But Anna (Juliette Binoche)'s charm and beauty were irresistible. Alex joins the elders. Alex's dance to David Bowie's Modern Love illustrates unfolding emotions of young Alex moving into an adult (graying if not dying) world. The interplay among the generations, between genders, among social classes, memory and hopes, all played against black and white and occasional red back drop. Anna's cobalt blue robe punctuates the moment when Alex confesses his love for her.", "Language": "French", "Country": "Switzerland, France", "Awards": "3 wins & 6 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwODE4NzI2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE2NjQ3MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "74", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "6,294", "imdbID": "tt0091497", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "01 May 2001", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "France 3 Cin\u00e9ma", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.3/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "92%", "MetacriticRating": "74/100"}
