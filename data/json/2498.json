One night, a homeless man sleeps in the foyer of her apartment house; she gives him a hot meal, then a place on the floor to sleep by her radiator, then she offers herself. She falls in love, giving him new life, clothes, a place to live. When he grouses that he must bar hop while she uses the flat for her work, she finds them a larger flat. He grows restless, seducing a manicurist and pressing her to prostitution. He's arrested for procuring, so Marie must decide what to do; he, too, must face the consequences of his choices.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "1 win & 3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk4ZjIyZGMtMzhiNi00NTAyLWJmZjEtODRhMDNhNDRhYjQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzQzODY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.5", "imdbVotes": "1,235", "imdbID": "tt0117073", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "14 Apr 1998", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.5/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "33%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
