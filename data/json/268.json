She is the last resident of the Aquarius, an original two-story building, built in the 1940s, in the upper-class, seaside Boa Viagem Avenue, Recife. All the neighboring apartments have already been acquired by a company which has other plans for that plot. Clara has pledged to only leave her place upon her death, and will engage in a cold war of sorts with the company. This tension both disturbs Clara and gives her that edge on her daily routine. It also gets her thinking about her loved ones, her past and her future.", "Language": "Portuguese", "Country": "Brazil, France", "Awards": "46 wins & 44 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg0NTc2MTM4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjIyMjc4ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "88", "imdbRating": "7.5", "imdbVotes": "16,504", "imdbID": "tt5221584", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$285,930", "Production": "Vitagraph Films", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.5/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "97%", "MetacriticRating": "88/100"}
