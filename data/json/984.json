The crown prince is murdered by one of his brothers who then becomes emperor. Shi retreats to a monastery, perhaps to hide, perhaps to plan a coup. When his loyal troops as well as the princess he desires are slain, he seeks refuge in a remote, abandoned monastery where an aged abbot schools him with practical, earthy teachings. The emperor's forces pursue Shi: first a woman, then a general seek to overpower him with lust and might. Over the course of the film, the reds of battle give way to blues of meditation.", "Language": "Mandarin, Cantonese", "Country": "Hong Kong", "Awards": "6 wins & 13 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MDM0NTU2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUwNDMzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.6", "imdbVotes": "308", "imdbID": "tt0108630", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "29 Aug 1995", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.6/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
