Patriotically singing \"God Save Mrs. Ethel Shroake, Long Live Mrs. Ethel Shroake\", they wander through this surrealistic landscape, forever being warned by the police to \"keep moving\", and prone to the occasional mutation into a parrot, cupboard, or even, yes, a bed sitting room with \"No Wogs\" scrawled in the grime on its windows. In particular, this story revolves around the odd \"love story\" of a girl who lives with her parents in one compartment of a London Underground train, the commuter in the next compartment, and the doctor they meet after returning above ground in search of a nurse for the heavily pregnant girl.", "Language": "English", "Country": "UK", "Awards": "2 wins & 2 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRlYjE4OGItNzUzNy00MTUwLThkY2MtMTA4NGZjMTYxY2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.2", "imdbVotes": "1,906", "imdbID": "tt0064074", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "United Artists", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.2/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "64%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
