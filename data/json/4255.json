Later that day, he's visited by Magali, his ex-wife, who tells him that she's remarrying and is pregnant. Olivier seems to follow instinctive responses: \"why today?\" he demands of Magali; he continues to follow Francis; he changes his mind about enrolling the youth. What's the history between the two?
