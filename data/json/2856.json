He needs the cash to free Leonidas from prison because the latter once saved his life when he was behind bars. For Stratos, this is simply a question of honour. We've no idea how many people he's already killed, but we do notice that he still has a conscience. He attentively looks after a neighbour's child, eight-year-old Katharina, as well as her mother and an uncle. At last he has enough money for the prison break-out. But Leonidas is lured into a bloody trap, by his brother of all people, who disappears with the money. At the same time Stratos learns that little Katharina is in danger - both psychologically and physically. He must act, even if this means following one wrongdoing with another.", "Language": "Greek", "Country": "Greece, Germany, Cyprus", "Awards": "6 wins & 12 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGZhOTg5NDgtNTlmYy00ZTg5LTk5YmEtYTg1MTBiZTk0MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM1MzAzOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "1,716", "imdbID": "tt3259474", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Faliro House Productions", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.0/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
