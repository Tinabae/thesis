They need money, and a permanent resident status. Claudy is a junkie - he needs money to satisfy his addiction. Andrei, the cigarette smuggler, must hold up for a while outside Russia; he has loads of money. Fabio, the Italian taxi driver and aspiring gang boss, elaborates a clever scheme: he will pay Claudy to marry Lorna so that she acquires a Belgian citizenship. Then she is to re-marry Andrei, who will in this way obtain the coveted EU passport - and pay a hefty price to Fabio and Lorna for the service. Like all plans, this one will not survive the contact with reality.", "Language": "French, Albanian, Russian", "Country": "Belgium, France, Italy, Germany", "Awards": "3 wins & 11 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMjA1MTY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTExNTA4MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "80", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "8,005", "imdbID": "tt1186369", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "20 May 2008", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.1/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "85%", "MetacriticRating": "80/100"}
