Florence Victoire, who is better known by her stage name Cl\u00e9o Victoire (as in Cleopatra), is a singer with three hit singles to her name, and as such some renown. Two days ago, she went in for some tests for abdominal issues to see if it is cancer. She will be getting the results today at 18:30h. She is certain that it will be a terminal cancer diagnosis, her mind fixated on that outcome and what it actually means. This belief affects how she approaches the day, from her encounters with friends and acquaintances to what she observes in total strangers around her. It could be as simple as how she views the lyrics to new songs presented to her from her songwriting team, to her feelings about a conversation she overhears in a caf\u00e9 between a couple having relationship problems, to the typical sweet nothings spoken to her from her lover, Jos\u00e9. There are certain things that do temporarily take her mind off of waiting for the test results, but something will always bring her back to that as the issue of her day. It isn't until just before she is ready to call the doctor that she may get a different perspective of the day and thus her life in a chance meeting with a stranger named Antoine, a French soldier at the very end of a three week leave from the Algerian War.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France, Italy", "Awards": "1 win & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJjYzU2NjMtNzUwMS00NzFlLTg5OGItZjg5ZWM2ZWI2MTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA2ODMzMDU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.9", "imdbVotes": "12,987", "imdbID": "tt0055852", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "16 May 2000", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Zenith International Films", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "96%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
