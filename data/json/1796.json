The choir tries to cheer up the mood by a German song, but then avoidance is replaced by hostility. When asking to buy bread they are referred to a woman who gives them a box with 437 empty cartridges, the remnants of the murders. By \"Yugoslavian for tourists\" a young boy makes contact with a woman who became mentally ill then. She misunderstands his words so that she will get her son back if she will bake bread. Meanwhile the men steal and slaughter a pig. Then the women throw their car down a mountain-side. On the next day the choir and the women reconcile. A priest from a nearby village finds a car they may borrow for one day. Since their own car is insured they do not report the women. When they leave, the mentally ill woman runs after to give them the bread she has baked.", "Language": "German, Serbo-Croatian", "Country": "West Germany, Yugoslavia", "Awards": "2 wins & 2 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1MjUxMjE0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkzNTAzMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.8", "imdbVotes": "58", "imdbID": "tt0058190", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.8/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
