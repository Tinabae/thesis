The two decide that rather than turn Basini in to the school authorities, they will punish him themselves and proceed to torture, degrade, and humiliate the boy, with ever-increasing sadistic delight. As each day passes, the two boys are able to justify harsher treatment than previously given. Torless is a passive member of the group but observes rather than participates and frustrates the tormentors by dryly analyzing their behavior.", "Language": "German", "Country": "West Germany, France", "Awards": "4 wins & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDllOWMwOWMtOGIwNi00ZTRmLWE1ZjAtMjk4NDdmYWRhOTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzgzODI1OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "2,002", "imdbID": "tt0060574", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "15 Mar 2005", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Criterion Collection", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.3/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
