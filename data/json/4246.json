It's one of several vignettes of Palestinian life in Israel - in a neighborhood in Nazareth and at Al-Ram checkpoint in East Jerusalem. Most of the stories are droll, some absurd, one is mythic and fanciful; few words are spoken. A man who goes through his mail methodically each morning has a heart attack. His son visits him in hospital. The son regularly meets a woman at Al-Ram; they sit in a car, hands caressing. Once, she defies Israeli guards at the checkpoint; later, Ninja-like, she takes on soldiers at a target range. A red balloon floats free overhead. Neighbors toss garbage over walls. Life goes on until it doesn't.", "Language": "Arabic, Hebrew, English", "Country": "France, Morocco, Germany, Palestine", "Awards": "6 wins & 2 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Mzc0MDQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc2ODkyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "74", "imdbRating": "6.6", "imdbVotes": "3,122", "imdbID": "tt0274428", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "12 Jul 2005", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Avatar Films Domestic Theatric", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.6/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "81%", "MetacriticRating": "74/100"}
