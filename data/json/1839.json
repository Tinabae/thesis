Right beside her, though, is her best friend and Svengali, Alan. He helps her get 12 cashmere sweaters, a job in the principal's office, spring break at Balboa, and more. Along the way, the satire bites teen mores, beach-blanket bikini movies, adults in charge, the country-club set, Christian-youth programs, older men's fantasies, and teen girls' innocence. How popular will Barbara Ann become, and what lengths will Alan go to get her there?", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "1 win & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMTA4NTU1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTUzNzA2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.6", "imdbVotes": "1,411", "imdbID": "tt0060636", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "02 Dec 2003", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "United Artists", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.6/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "71%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
