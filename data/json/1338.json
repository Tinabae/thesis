Along with projecting his own faults onto his father, his own jealousy for lack of success and accomplishment onto his younger brother, and wallowing in the blind support of his mother, it's just another aspect of Abe's unsatisfying life that he just can't see to improve. A long-overdue decision finally spins his insignificant life out of control.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "4 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5MDNjMDgtYjRlNy00ZGEyLWI3OTItZWIxYTcyY2FhNGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "66", "imdbRating": "5.9", "imdbVotes": "5,425", "imdbID": "tt1690455", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "13 Nov 2012", "BoxOffice": "$166,228", "Production": "Vitagraph Films", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "5.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "70%", "MetacriticRating": "66/100"}
