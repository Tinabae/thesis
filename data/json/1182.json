He has heart problems, seeks a transplant, and then goes in search of a son sired years before in Tahiti. Told elliptically, with few words, we see Louis as possibly heartless, ignoring a son who lives nearby who is himself an attentive father to two young children, one named for Louis. He leaves his bed one night - and his lover - to kill an intruder; he dreams, usually of violence. Will his body accept his heart? Will his son accept his offer?", "Language": "French, English, Korean, Russian, Polynesian", "Country": "France", "Awards": "4 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU4MTAyMTc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg0NzIzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "85", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "1,594", "imdbID": "tt0422491", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "25 Apr 2006", "BoxOffice": "$4,640", "Production": "Wellspring", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "86%", "MetacriticRating": "85/100"}
