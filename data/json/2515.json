He is plagued by severe neck pain. His father is bedeviled by water first leaking into his bedroom and then flooding the apartment; rain is incessant. Xiao-kang's mother is overcome by sexual longing for her son, sometimes making seemingly incestuous overtures. They try virtually every intervention for Xiao-kang's neck: Western medicine, a chiropractor, acupuncture, an herbal doctor, and a faith healer, Master Liu. Are the family's silent dynamics and Xiao-kang's neck pain connected? And what about the body floating in the Tamsui River: is everything dead?", "Language": "Mandarin", "Country": "Taiwan", "Awards": "6 wins & 7 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODkwNjk5NzAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYwMTMyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "55", "imdbRating": "7.4", "imdbVotes": "2,151", "imdbID": "tt0119263", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "04 Feb 2003", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Kimstim", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.4/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "70%", "MetacriticRating": "55/100"}
