Nomadic shepherds, plagued by drought, happen on a fishing encampment with plentiful fresh water. The local men are away but will return when it rains; the shepherds stay to refresh their flock until the rain comes. A shepherd lad and a local girl, both on the verge of puberty, start a mating dance. Also, one of the shepherds approaches a beautiful local woman, inviting her to sleep with him. How will she respond? She's married, her husband at sea for the week. Is love forever or temporary? A subtext dramatizes the capture of fish, birds, foxes, and other animals: their fates seem arbitrary.", "Language": "Greek", "Country": "Greece", "Awards": "8 wins & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRiNTU4ZDUtYjE3NS00NjA2LWFkMWMtNDYzNzg3ZWJkNmZkL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg3MTIwODI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "663", "imdbID": "tt0057307", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "08 May 2007", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.8/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
