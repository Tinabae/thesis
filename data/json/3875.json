But Woyzeck, a rifleman assigned as an orderly, hears voices -- the times are out of joint, at least in his cosmos. To his captain, Woyzeck is a comic marvel: ignorant but courageous, full of energy to little purpose. To a local doctor, Woyzeck is a curiosity, the object of cruel study. Woyzeck, 40, has a young wife, Marie, and a small child. He dotes on them, but Marie, even though she has periods of guilt and remorse, carries on affairs and flirtations. When the captain lets drop broad hints of Woyzeck's being a cuckold, his inner demons and the voices of the spheres take over. Will madness bring action? Of what sort?", "Language": "German", "Country": "West Germany", "Awards": "3 wins & 3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNzIzMzIyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ2MzkwMzE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "8,340", "imdbID": "tt0080149", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "28 Mar 1991", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Gaumont", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.1/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "83%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
