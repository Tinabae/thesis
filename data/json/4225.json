They wait for dark, trading insults and even finding some common ground; sometimes one has the gun, sometimes the other, sometimes both. Things get complicated when another wounded Bosnian comes to, but can't move because a bouncing mine is beneath him. The two men cooperate to wave white flags, their lines call the UN (whose high command tries not to help), an English reporter shows up, a French sergeant shows courage, and the three men in no man's land may or may not find a way to all get along.", "Language": "Bosnian, French, English, Serbian", "Country": "France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Belgium, UK, Slovenia", "Awards": "Won 1 Oscar.
