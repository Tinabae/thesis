Her troubles start when she's court-appointed to defend Palestinian Salim Bakri, who's been arrested and charged by the military tribunal with belonging to a terrorist network. Bakri claims that he's an innocent victim of prosecution by the Israeli state, because he wants his family's property back. Hanna investigates his claims and realizes that he may not be lying. The prosecutor proposes a way to both get rid of Bakri and not give in to his demands. Hanna must decide whether to give in and possibly save her client's life or fight for what she, as the child of Holocaust survivors, believes to be right.
