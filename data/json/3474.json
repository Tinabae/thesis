An honorable end to such fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted disembowelment). An elder warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at the house but was instead barbarically forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in an excruciating manner with a dull bamboo blade. In flashbacks the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo thus sets in motion a tense showdown of revenge against the house.", "Language": "Japanese", "Country": "Japan", "Awards": "8 wins & 2 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBmYTQ1NjItZWU5MS00YjI0LTg2OTYtYmFkN2JkMmNiNWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "85", "imdbRating": "8.7", "imdbVotes": "30,430", "imdbID": "tt0056058", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "23 Aug 2005", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Criterion Collection", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "8.7/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "100%", "MetacriticRating": "85/100"}
