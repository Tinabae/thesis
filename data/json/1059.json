Each of the five women, different from the other in temperament and capability, is the emotional support system, although at times reluctantly, for each other, with the eldest assuming the role of a 'somewhat meddling' overseer. But then into this comes an elderly brother, a priest too senile to perform his clerical functions, who has \"come home to die\" after a lifetime in Africa; as well, there also arrives the boy's father, riding up on a motorcycle, only to announce that he's on his way to Spain to fight against Franco. Nevertheless, life goes on for the five sisters, although undeniably affected by the presence of the two men, they continue to cope as a close-knit unit... until something happens that disrupts the very fabric of that cohesiveness beyond repair.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Ireland, UK, USA", "Awards": "2 wins & 7 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM3MTU4ZjYtMGI4Zi00MWFmLTg4MWUtN2FiMjRjNDFjMTEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "3,285", "imdbID": "tt0120643", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "15 Jun 1999", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.3/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "64%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
