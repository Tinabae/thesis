The posting is something of a disappointment to the father, who was hoping for a promotion. That his wife had left him seems to have affected his career. Nicholas sees it all as something of an adventure and soon becomes fast friends with the new gardener, Jose. The apparently \"delicate\" Nicholas becomes attached to Jose, and father's jealousy leads him to bar Nicholas from even speaking to the gardener. As tensions mount, another servant frames Jose for theft forcing everyone to review the situation.", "Language": "English", "Country": "UK", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTFiZWI5NjgtNDgyMy00MGQ0LWIwNjMtMTA3MWNmZjZiMWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "608", "imdbID": "tt0049787", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "VCI Entertainment", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
