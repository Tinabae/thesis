The Sanmo-kai chairman learns that his henchman Ikemoto has struck an alliance with the drug-dealing Murase family, and is not best pleased, to say the least. The ensuing retaliation triggers an orgy of killings, territorial invasions and score settling while law enforcement officers are too corrupt to intervene.", "Language": "Japanese, English", "Country": "Japan", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTdlYTZmNDctYzFlYy00ODc1LThiY2YtNjMzNDNlMjQwNzYzL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "67", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "11,424", "imdbID": "tt1462667", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "31 Jan 2012", "BoxOffice": "$29,633", "Production": "Magnolia Pictures", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.8/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "79%", "MetacriticRating": "67/100"}
