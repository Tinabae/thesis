Two friends dream of escaping the oppression of communist GDR in 1980s in Berlin. When they finally make an attempt, however, they are captured by the authorities and imprisoned. In jail, they allow themselves to be indoctrinated into the hate-fueled neo-Nazi movement to try and survive their incarceration.
