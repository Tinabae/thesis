One year after World War II, Captain Fisby is sent to the village of Tobiki in Okinawa to teach the people democracy. The first step is to build a school -- but the wily Okinawans know what they really want.

Fisby has a hard time breaking this news to his superiors.", "Language": "English, Japanese", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "Nominated for 6 Golden Globes.
