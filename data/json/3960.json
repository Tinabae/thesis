His work is impeded by some aborigines who explain that this is the place where the green ants dream. Disturbing their dreaming will destroy humanity they claim. Hackett informs the company which offers various \"solutions\" such as a large amount of money or a percentage of a possible revenue. Invited on a trip to a city some of the aborigines sees a military aeroplane and express the wish to own it. The company buys it and gives it to the aborigines as a sign of good will. A runway is made in the desert and the plane is flown to the location. All negotiations concerning the area fail and the dispute goes to a court of the Commonwealth. Parties and experts are heard, obstacles are met such as an aborigine who is the sole survivor of his tribe (and language) and therefore no-one understands what he is saying. Two of the aborigines take off in the plane despite that there is very little fuel left. The mining company wins legally and the aborigines morally. Some aborigines arrives from the mountains and tells about a big winged ant that had fallen from the sky.", "Language": "English", "Country": "West Germany, Australia", "Awards": "2 wins & 2 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI0YmI2ZTctZmMwYS00NDZkLWEzZWQtMGRhNzUxNjBiOGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDYzNTI2ODc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "1,905", "imdbID": "tt0088412", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "26 Sep 2006", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Orion Classics", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.1/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "80%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
