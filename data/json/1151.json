When released, he calls on the family of the victim; they send him away, but not before he has seen Gong-ju, a young woman disabled severely by cerebral palsy. Both are abused by their families, and both are used by them as well. Although their relationship begins with Jong-du's criminal behavior, a friendship develops. They talk of favorite things; he washes her hair; they go out; in late night phone calls, he helps her past her fears of the dark. Is there a place in the world for these two inarticulate people?", "Language": "Korean", "Country": "South Korea", "Awards": "21 wins & 2 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjYwNGYwM2ItZGFmMy00ZjdiLWJjNWMtNTA4YjA1MTc0OTdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjcxNjI4NTk@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "79", "imdbRating": "7.9", "imdbVotes": "7,429", "imdbID": "tt0320193", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "23 Nov 2004", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Lifesize Entertainment", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "90%", "MetacriticRating": "79/100"}
