Esther is a veterinarian who is certain that her sister has been murdered by her brother-in-law. She convinces two members of the Academie Francaise, the prestigious institution that protects the virginity of the French language, to investigate. Both men are enamored of the woman and are quite willing to enter into competition for her favors. As might be expected from academicians of any ilk, they are inept at digging into a murder mystery and bumble their way through one incident after another. Corpses continue to pile up (not in front of the camera, however) while the two men are sidetracked by their interest in language. Given their positions, they do not want that murdered either.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI0NzYzODgwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI0OTE5MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "4.3", "imdbVotes": "68", "imdbID": "tt0089613", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "4.3/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
