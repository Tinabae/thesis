He may be blind but that does not mean he cannot see. On his way to work, he could tell the quality of the bread the young girls along the streets are peddling by simply touching their ware. His world is made more colorful and quaint because of his sensitivity to his surroundings. The only problem is that he is easily \"tempted\" by street musicians' performances and arrives late at work.", "Language": "Persian, Tajik, Russian", "Country": "Iran, Tajikistan, France", "Awards": "3 wins & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ4MDUwMTE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY0OTMyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "1,244", "imdbID": "tt0152438", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "17 Jul 2001", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "New Yorker Films", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "83%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
