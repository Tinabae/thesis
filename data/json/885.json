She promotes feminism and laments a shift in the men from self-defense to aggression. Her friend, Else Lasker-Schuler (1869 - 1945), expressionist poet and German Jew, is in Berlin, writing, caring for her son, watching Hitler's movement take power. She goes to Jerusalem and imagines a park for Arab and Jew. Her poems, voiced from within, capture her experience. The film meditates on the violence at the root of Israel's birth: of the Nazis and of the Zionists.", "Language": "Hebrew, German, English, French", "Country": "Israel, Netherlands, Italy, France, UK", "Awards": "2 wins & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJmYzcxZmUtYTM0MC00MzVlLTk2ZTMtZWI3ODVjOTZmZmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMyMzI4MzY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.0", "imdbVotes": "53", "imdbID": "tt0133410", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "29 Apr 2003", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.0/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
