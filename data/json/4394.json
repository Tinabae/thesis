Includes the marathon, men's diving, and American track star Jesse Owen's sprint races at the 1936 Olympic games. The production tends to glorify the young male body and, some say, expresses the Nazi attitude toward athletic prowess. Includes the lighting of the torch at the stadium and Adolf Hitler looking on in amazement as Jesse Owens wins an unprecedented four Gold Medals.", "Language": "German, English, Italian, French, Japanese, Portuguese", "Country": "Germany", "Awards": "2 wins.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMzM4NDk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUzOTA2MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.8", "imdbVotes": "4,091", "imdbID": "tt0030522", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "13 Nov 2007", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.8/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
