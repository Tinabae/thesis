A voice off-camera looks back ten years to 2000, when Vicky was in an on-again off-again relationship with Hao-Hao. She's young, lovely, and aimless. He's a slacker. Cigarettes and alcohol fuel her nights. We see bits of her life: when Hao-Hao steals his father's Rolex and the police detain them; when she gets a job as a club hostess, where she meets Jack, who becomes her patron and protector; when Hao-Hao comes to the club, insisting on talking to her; when she visits Yubari, Japan, for its film festival in the dead of winter; when Jack must go to Japan to straighten out trouble caused by one of his acolytes. Does Vicky have any expectations? Does time simply pass?", "Language": "English, Japanese, Mandarin", "Country": "Taiwan, France", "Awards": "6 wins & 9 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4ODAwMzMwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQxMDgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "73", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "4,232", "imdbID": "tt0283283", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "17 Aug 2004", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Palm Pictures", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.1/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "81%", "MetacriticRating": "73/100"}
