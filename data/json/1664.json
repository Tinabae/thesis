Pepe, a hothead jailed once for violence, is tested when a drunken sailor's chance remark gets him doubting that his wife Magdalena's child is his. After a six-year absence, gringo Jim Gatsby is in town with a scheme to make a lot of money using a depth reader to locate schools of shrimp: he'll wait outside the limits of Mexican waters and shrimpers will bring him their catch. It's illegal, but should be foolproof. The fishing scheme goes awry as Pepe's jealousy consumes him. If adults think only of themselves, can a child's innocence save anyone?", "Language": "Spanish", "Country": "Mexico", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1ODAxMjE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODU5MTYzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "54", "imdbID": "tt0050400", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "21 Feb 2006", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "VCI", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.0/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
