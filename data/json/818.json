In his truck he finds a young girl who has just been abandoned and has no roots. Spiros lets her follow for a day. Seeing her difficulty in getting further hitch-hiking, he takes her back. They will meet and part several times. Later she will say that Spiros is the only one who has ever been kind to her. But his emotions are so restrained that he cannot show anything until a volcanic eruption breaks through. He does not seek serious contact until the eruption makes him drive the car right through the glass wall of the caf\u00e9 in which the girl is sitting. She immediately follows him. But after this criminal event they can no longer live at hotels. From the beginning she was willing to sleep with him. But when he finally kisses her, her justified reaction is to repeat \"Not in this way!\" A friend had a shut down cinema where they could sleep. Endlessly she goes around starch naked. Fully clothed he is smoking and completely ignores her. What finally happens is almost a rape. The girl leaves him afterwards. When he realises what he has lost, he overturns all beehives and the bees kill him.", "Language": "Greek, French", "Country": "Greece, France", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFmZmRkYjktYjE2Zi00NGFlLThhMzYtZmZmZDU0NzU2YzE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MDEzMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.4", "imdbVotes": "1,743", "imdbID": "tt0091506", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.4/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
