After a suicidal teenage girl gives birth, she misguidedly entrusts her baby's safety to the troubled, deadbeat father, whose violent actions take the viewer on a tour of the foreboding, crumbling shantytown in which they live. With its reserved, shadowy cinematography by Emmanuel Machuel (who collaborated with Bresson on L'argent), Ossos is a haunting look at a devastated community.", "Language": "Portuguese", "Country": "Portugal, France, Denmark", "Awards": "2 wins & 6 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIzZGExYmQtZTJiYy00OTgzLWFjNDMtMmYxZTdiNTkxM2MyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY5MDUyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "1,318", "imdbID": "tt0119844", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
