Spending her time between high profile fashion establishments and the abandoned Lewis' house in Paris, Maureen is silently battling with the gut-wrenching grief and sorrow, while at the same time, looking for a sign from her deceased brother after an oath taken between the twins. Aloof, disoriented and still mourning, wraithlike Maureen attuned to the ethereal realm, is inevitably caught between this world and the spiritual, always looking for portholes and a sign that would prove her brother right, however, in vain. Unexpectedly, as the days pass by swiftly and the random apparitions become more frequent, Maureen will start to receive strange text messages from an unknown sender who seems to know a lot about her, but in the end, if there is still no sign of the beloved Lewis, is there any point in waiting?", "Language": "English, French, Swedish, German", "Country": "France, Germany, Czech Republic, Belgium", "Awards": "9 wins & 22 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2JhYTViMGUtMTU0Ni00MzU5LWE0ZmYtNDk2YTdmOTI5MTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIyODMzMzA@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "77", "imdbRating": "6.1", "imdbVotes": "33,522", "imdbID": "tt4714782", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$1,305,195", "Production": "IFC Films", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.1/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "80%", "MetacriticRating": "77/100"}
