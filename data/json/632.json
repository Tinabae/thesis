{"Title": "Muriel, or the Time of Return", "Year": "1963", "Rated": "Not Rated", "Released": "13 Mar 2007", "Runtime": "115 min", "Genre": "Drama", "Director": "Alain Resnais", "Writer": "Jean Cayrol (scenario and dialogue)", "Actors": "Delphine Seyrig, Jean-Pierre K\u00e9rien, Nita Klein, Jean-Baptiste Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e", "Plot": "In the seacoast town of Boulogne, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne sells antique furniture, living with her step-son, Bernard, who's back from military duty in Algiers. An old lover of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's comes to visit - Alphonse - with his niece Fran\u00e7oise; he too is back from Algiers, where he ran a caf\u00e9. Bernard speaks of his fianc\u00e9e, Muriel, whom H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has not met. The narrative, like memory and intention, is jumpy, the past obscured by guilt, misperceptions, and missed possibilities. Appearances deceive, things change. As H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Alphonse try to sort out a renewal, everyone seems off-kilter just enough to hint that all cannot end well. Can anyone know another?", "Language": "French", "Country": "France, Italy", "Awards": "3 wins & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmFmODU0NTYtZWVlMi00OWRkLThjOTAtYzg4ODg3MDRkMDRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU5MjcxOTg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.5", "imdbVotes": "2,433", "imdbID": "tt0057336", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "13 Mar 2007", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Lopert Pictures Corporation", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.5/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "85%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
