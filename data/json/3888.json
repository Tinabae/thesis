Her behavior is bizarre, perhaps mad: she poisons the dog's milk and advises the dog not to drink it; she sets the sheets afire as her husband sleeps; she crawls under the dining table to sing. While detained at airport customs for carrying pruning shears, she meets a young Yugoslav woman and goes with her to a Gypsy enclave where she's fought over, takes a lover, helps with the sordid entertainment at a bar, and returns home more dangerous than before. The film also tells parallel stories of Marilyn's daughter becoming a junior homemaker as the young immigrant practices her striptease.", "Language": "English, Swedish", "Country": "Sweden, UK", "Awards": "1 win & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWM5NDhiOGQtNjQyNy00MzM2LWFhMTAtNTUyZGJhZWVhZTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.7", "imdbVotes": "1,801", "imdbID": "tt0082770", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "11 Sep 2001", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Atlantic Releasing Corporation", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.7/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "88%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
