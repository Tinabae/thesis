When ruthless thug and pimp Johnny Vanning takes over all the clubs in town, the girls are forced to follow Vanning's rules and kick back on their \"tips\" in exchange for protection.

Unfortunately the more naive Mary Lou is impressed by Vanning's oily veneer of materialism and accepts invitations to \"entertain\" at the gangster's private parties. Mary's naive younger sister Betty arrives from college just when Mary and her roommates are arrested as material witnesses in the murder of one of the casino's non-paying customers.

Betty consents to accompany Emmy Lou to one of Vanning's private parties where the gangster ends up killing her for not submitting to the advances of one of the party's guests.

Even so, Mary agrees to testify - and at her bedside, all the other hostesses decide to follow her example in the coming hearing.
