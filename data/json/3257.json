Magoo thinks that the flyer is a letter from his mother about her \"83rd birthday\" and begins to worry that maybe he hasn't spent enough time with his mother lately. He goes to pay his mother a visit to make up for lost time but upon arriving, Mother Magoo doesn't quite appreciate Magoo's attempts at being helpful such as baking a feather duster thinking it to be a turkey dinner. So she uses psychology to eventually persuade him to go back home (at least until next year).", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NjU1ODAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU4MDEyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "16", "imdbID": "tt0151526", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
