Realistic scenes mix with dream sequences and hallucinations. The realistic episodes feature Gabrielle, a young woman living in a trailer on a beach in northern france. She works in a bar, drinks a little too much and is a big fan of aging rock/blues singer Lennox. A more dreamlike storyline shows seemingly the same woman disorientatedly wandering through an American city and meeting Lennox after a concert.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTlkOWUwYTQtNTZlMS00ODg0LWI2ZjAtZGQ5ZDM4OTAwNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQzMzc4MzQ@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.0", "imdbVotes": "148", "imdbID": "tt0211554", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.0/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
