She loves her idle boyfriend Raoul who gambles away what little she earns. The town's power broker, called the rich Jew, discovers she is a good listener, so she's soon busy. Raoul imagines grotesque sex scenes between Lily and the Jew; he leaves her for a man. Her parents, a bitter Fascist who is a cabaret singer in drag and her wheelchair-bound mother, offer no refuge. Even though all have a philosophical bent, the other whores reject Lily because she tolerates everyone, including men. She tires of her lonely life and looks for a way out. Even that act serves the local corrupt powers.", "Language": "German", "Country": "Switzerland, West Germany", "Awards": "2 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkxOTdiY2ItZTAzNy00YjAzLWIzYTktMTUyYzE2MDFlNGIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM1MzIyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "154", "imdbID": "tt0075169", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "23 Aug 1996", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.0/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
