He can't find anyone who can fulfill this longing. Cast into self-doubt, he leaves his wife and children in pursuit of the path of his role model, Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Until now, he has kept out of political struggles and away from the Union, who wanted him to paint their flag. Yet his experiences on the journey eventually drag him into the political struggle. He sees how the mute Barbara, who had saved his life, is killed by a bishop. A swain, who was his Christ Figure, became executioner and then got hanged himself. A juggler had to pay for the delivery of truth with his own life. Now Ratgeb paints how he really sees things.
