They have lived alone for years in their own private world, full of memories and daily rites. Sometimes they seem like brothers. Sometimes even like lovers. Following in his father's path, Aleksei attends military school. He likes sports, tends to be irresponsible and has problems with his girlfriend. She is jealous of Aleksei's close relationship with his father. Despite knowing that all sons must one day live their own lives, Aleksei is conflicted; his father knows he should accept a better job in another city, perhaps search for a new wife, but who will ease the pain of Aleksei's nightmares?", "Language": "Russian", "Country": "Russia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, France", "Awards": "2 wins & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMTMxMjAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQwMzYyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "64", "imdbRating": "6.6", "imdbVotes": "2,290", "imdbID": "tt0363249", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "26 Oct 2004", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Wellspring", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.6/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "68%", "MetacriticRating": "64/100"}
