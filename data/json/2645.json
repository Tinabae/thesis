Vincent paints; some of what he sees is artifice. The sounds are of trains, boats, factory horns, and people singing. Men watch women, sometimes priests join in the looking, sometimes not. A crocodile appears in a garden. With money his father gives him, Vincent takes a journey to Venice. He sees the city from a roof top, the view is a gift from a friend. One of his sons hang-glides with a girl friend. Vincent comes home to go back to work. What is it to taste wine and to be alive?", "Language": "French, Italian, Romanian", "Country": "France, Italy", "Awards": "3 wins & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNDM3MTQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc4MDkxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "968", "imdbID": "tt0284277", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "02 May 2006", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Kino on Video", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.8/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "71%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
