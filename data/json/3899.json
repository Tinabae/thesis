In 1958, the body of Eva Szalanczky, a political journalist, is discovered near the border. Her friend Livia is in hospital with a broken neck; Livia's husband, Donci, is under arrest. In a flashback to the year before, we see what leads up to the tragedy. Eva gets a job as a writer. She meets Livia and is attracted to her. Livia feels much the same, but as a married woman, has doubts and hesitations. In their work, they (and Eva in particular) bang up against the limits of telling political truths; in private, they confront the limits of living out sexual and emotional truth.", "Language": "Hungarian", "Country": "Hungary", "Awards": "4 wins & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5OTIzNTAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA0MTAyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.2", "imdbVotes": "710", "imdbID": "tt0083872", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "26 Sep 2006", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.2/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
