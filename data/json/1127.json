Since the beginning of the 1970s, the Cammarano family has extended its rule over a wide territory, with coldness and no scruples. Nobody would dare to dispute its control and its increased power. Yet things are bound to change, as the new generations feel estranged from their own lives. The balance within the family starts to collapse, and the old grudges re-emerge. Red Moon shows the end of the family, at the hands of a young offspring. It is the end of the Mafia family.
