They love, they argue, fists fly. A dog strays between town and country. The seasons pass. The man and woman meet again. The dog finds itself between them. The other is in one, the one is in the other and they are three. The former husband shatters everything. A second film begins: the same as the first, and yet not. From the human race we pass to metaphor. This ends in barking and a baby's cries.", "Language": "French, English, German", "Country": "Switzerland, France", "Awards": "3 wins & 18 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDJjMTQ1N2YtN2IxMi00OTliLWI2MDMtM2Q4YzZhMDJjYmU4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzIwNjc5NzA@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "75", "imdbRating": "5.9", "imdbVotes": "5,114", "imdbID": "tt2400275", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "14 Apr 2015", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Kino Lorber", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "5.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "88%", "MetacriticRating": "75/100"}
