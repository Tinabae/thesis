Police almost immediately arrest the mother Ingrid who is the mistress of the father, a rich business VIP married to someone else. His position and wealth keep him insulated from suspicion. A hot-shot lawyer has to overcome the unaccountably biased perceptions of the police, the judge, the prosecutor and almost everyone else in the judicial system. The defense lawyer, driven to an extreme, knows he has to find the real killer or his client will be convicted.", "Language": "German", "Country": "West Germany", "Awards": "2 wins & 3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkN2U2NTItMTgxMy00NTBiLTljZDEtMTU4ZjM2NzFmOTZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzA4ODc3ODU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.2", "imdbVotes": "69", "imdbID": "tt0054025", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.2/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
