He visits them once or twice a year, mainly to give them a chance to spend a few days with their grandson. His hopes of spending a quiet weekend with the family fall short when Gitte, who has been mentally unstable since Marko was a child, feels so healthy after a homeopathic treatment that she stops taking her medication. Her announcement triggers reserved reactions in the family, and a series of revelations tip his family's structure out of balance.", "Language": "German", "Country": "Germany", "Awards": "3 wins & 5 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3ZWFlZDYtZTg3Yi00ZDg5LTg1NDItZTc3MDZjY2MzZjc0L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzA3Njg4MzY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.5", "imdbVotes": "865", "imdbID": "tt2180587", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "23/5 Filmproduktion", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.5/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
