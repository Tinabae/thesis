What do we know? Night after night, not long before dawn, two young adults, Patricia and Emile, meet on a sound stage to discuss learning, discourse, and the path to revolution. Scenes of Paris's student revolt, the Vietnam War, and other events of the late 1960s, along with posters, photographs, and cartoons, are backdrops to their words. Words themselves are often Patricia and Emile's subject, as are images, sounds, and juxtapositions. In addition to the two characters' musings, the soundtrack includes narration, music, news clips, and noise. The result is a montage, a meditation, a reflection on ideas and how words and images mix - and how filmmaking is a path.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France, West Germany", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNjUyMTY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY3MTE2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "660", "imdbID": "tt0062997", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "13 May 2008", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Koch Vision", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.4/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
