Nobody there cares about Quebec and he doesn't seem to have anything in common with them at all. As he travels to see the places where Rimbaud was born, lived, and died, he meets two women who show him the warmth and kindness he was searching for. Jeanne, an impoverished young widow is saddled with loneliness and problems stemming from her delinquent brother and drunken father.
