This changes Isabelle's outlook on life: her favorite story is Anderson's \"Little Mermaid,\" and she thinks that in Georges she's found her prince. She follows him, engages him in conversation, and turns up at his flat. At first, he pushes her away and tells her she's nuts, but slowly he finds that she brings out of him a playful self, and he likes her devotion.
