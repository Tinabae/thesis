He's about 30, solitary, quiet, and big. He watches TV, likes heavy metal, and sometimes works as a bouncer at a disco. One night he notices one of the cleaning crew, Julia; he watches her via the cameras as she works, then follows some days as she goes to an Internet caf\u00e9, the beach, shopping, or the movies. He stays out of her sight and never talks to her. Thinking she may be hiding somewhere in the store with a male co-worker, Jarita breaks some rules and gets suspended. Then, while watching her one evening, she meets a man. What will Jara do?", "Language": "Spanish", "Country": "Uruguay, Argentina, Germany, Spain, Netherlands", "Awards": "16 wins & 5 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MDU0NDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY1NDI4Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "64", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "1,948", "imdbID": "tt1360866", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "09 Feb 2010", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Film Movement", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.8/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "94%", "MetacriticRating": "64/100"}
