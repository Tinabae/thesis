Jimmy Gralton is back home in the Irish countryside after ten years of forced exile in the USA. His widowed mother Alice is happy, Jimmy's friends are happy, all the young people who enjoy dancing and singing are happy. Which is not the case of Father Sheridan, the local priest, nor of the village squire, nor of Dennis O'Keefe, the chief of the fascists. The reason is simple: Jimmy is a socialist activist. So when the \"intruder\" reopens the village hall, thus enabling the villagers to gather to sing, dance, paint, study or box, they take a dim view of the whole thing. People who think and unite are difficult to manipulate, aren't they? From that moment on they will use every means possible to get rid of Jimmy and his \"dangerous\" hall.", "Language": "English, Irish", "Country": "UK, Ireland, France, Belgium, Japan", "Awards": "2 wins & 3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk0NDk4MzIzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMwMTA5MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "63", "imdbRating": "6.7", "imdbVotes": "5,468", "imdbID": "tt3110960", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Sony Pictures Classics", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.7/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "76%", "MetacriticRating": "63/100"}
