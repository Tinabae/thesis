Her husband, G\u00e9rard, a businessman and philanderer, hates the campaign and feels vindication when a nasty leaflet circulates about their family history. His son, Fran\u00e7ois, just back from the U.S., is in love with his step-sister Mich\u00e8le, and she with him, although something is amiss besides their being cousins. Watching it all is their elderly Aunt Line, who has her own haunting memories.
