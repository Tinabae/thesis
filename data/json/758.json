On the eve of the First World War, Count Forbek starts to build a fantastic castle in the Ardennes forest. After the war he uses it to start a utopian society by brainwashing his friends, including his former fiancee, Livia, and her husband. In the present day, the castle is being used as an alternative school and, in the summer holidays, for an educational conference. At the conference, the American Nora Winkle bets Claudine that the ernest public school teacher Elisabeth Rousseau will be enticed into the bed of Robert Dufresne, even though the principal speaker, Walter Guarini, is obviously interested in Elisabeth. Meanwhile, the children staying at the castle over the holidays invent their own medieval tale about freeing prisoners from the dungeons.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTVjNGRkNmEtYjgzYy00OGNiLWIzNDYtMzg5NjI5OGI3M2NiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIwNDY4NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "765", "imdbID": "tt0086542", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "19 Feb 2008", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "International Spectrafilm", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.3/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "75%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
