But A's real interest lies elsewhere--the mythical reels of the very first film shot by the Manakia brothers, who, at the dawn of the age of cinema, tirelessly criss-crossed the Balkans and, without regard for national and ethnic strife, recorded the region's history and customs. Did these primitive, never-developed images really exist? If so, where are they? - \"Why A? It's an alphabetical choice. Every filmmaker remembers the first time he looked through the viewfinder of a camera. It is a moment that is not so much the discovery of cinema--but the discovery of the world. But there comes a moment when the filmmaker begins to doubt his own capacity to see things, when he no longer knows if his gaze is right and innocent.\" --Theo Angelopoulos", "Language": "English, Greek, Bulgarian, Albanian, Serbian, Romanian, Kurdish, Macedonian, German", "Country": "Greece, France, Italy, Germany, UK, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Romania, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina", "Awards": "11 wins & 7 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjJmM2YwYjctMWJjYS00MWY1LThkZjctOGJiOTAwYzkxMWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIwNDY4NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.6", "imdbVotes": "5,329", "imdbID": "tt0114863", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "13 Feb 2001", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.6/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "31%", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
