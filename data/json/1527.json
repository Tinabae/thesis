Here, Angelika has an incurable disease but Dr. Holl, the fianc\u00e9 of Angelika's nurse, Helga, has discovered a serum that will relieve her pain and fear. Thus relieved, Angelika falls in love with Dr. Holl and her only wish is to marry him. Helga, seeing that it will mean some degree of happiness for Angelika in her few remaining days, gives her consent to this supposedly short-term arrangement. But the good doctor then actually discovers a cure for Angelika's disease, and also discovers he has fallen in love with his married-in-pity bride.
