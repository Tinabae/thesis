The Golbal Union President, played by Hilde Krahl, arrives in a flying-saucer with her retinue of world-soldiers, equipped with death-ray guns, to put an end to the rebellion. The president and the country are put on trial. The Austrian president recounts the country's' long battle for peace, and shows how Austria stopped the invasion of the Turks, and gave the world the operetta and the waltz.
