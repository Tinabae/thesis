But Legagneur's laughter and easy intimacy are empty of content for a book, and he's constantly dashing off, promising Wolf more time later. Wolf seems to have his own mask: he's brought a gun with him, and he's curious about a woman who was a recent guest at the estate. There's also Legagneur's godchild, Catherine, recovering from mental illness, and hovered over by Legagneur and his secretary. As Wolf digs through desks, he discovers a murderous plot. Can he now outfox his host?", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5NTkwN2EtYjk0Zi00N2NlLWE4MmQtODQxMjRmNmJmMGMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzQzODY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "1,093", "imdbID": "tt0093505", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "27 Jul 2004", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Criterion Collection", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.9/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "N/A"}
