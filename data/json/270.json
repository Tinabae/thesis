Her parents marry her to Jos\u00e9 (Alex Brendem\u00fchl), an honest and loving Spanish farm worker who they think will make a respectable woman of her. Despite Jos\u00e9's devotion to her, Gabrielle vows that she will never love Jos\u00e9 and lives like a prisoner bound by the constraints of conventional post-World War II society until the day she is sent away to a cure in the Alps to heal her kidney stones. There she meets Andr\u00e9 Sauvage (Louis Garrel), a dashing injured veteran of the Indochinese War, who rekindles the passion buried inside her. She promises they will run away together, and Andr\u00e9 seems to share her desire.
