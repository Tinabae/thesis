A young man, Adhir, comes to the Chowdhury household with a view to marry. He meets Sujata and falls in love with her. When he informs his aunt of this decision, she is aghast, as she knows that Sujata is not only of a lower caste but also an untouchable, and she wants Adhir to marry Rama, or will not permit him to live with her.
