Burroughs (novel), David Cronenberg", "Actors": "Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Ian Holm, Julian Sands", "Plot": "Not an adaptation of beat writer William S. Burrough's novel but a mix of biography and an interpretation of his drug- induced writing processes combined with elements of his work in this paranoid fantasy about Bill Lee, a writer who accidentally shoots his wife, whose typewriter transforms into a cockroach and who becomes involved in a mysterious plot in North African port called Interzone. Wonderfully bizarre, not unlike Burrough's books.", "Language": "English, Arabic", "Country": "Canada, UK, Japan", "Awards": "13 wins & 14 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRiOTQ2ZWQtMmIwYy00Y2Y3LWFmMzgtNzgzZWU1MDhlOGJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "67", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "44,425", "imdbID": "tt0102511", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "11 Nov 2003", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.1/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "69%", "MetacriticRating": "67/100"}
