Roubaud is a train conductor on the same railroad that Lantier works on, married to the much younger S\u00e9verine. When Roubaud catches wind of his wife's affair with her godfather, the wealthy M. Grandmorin, he kills him during a train journey in a fit of jealousy. He makes sure that S\u00e9verine is also present, making her an accomplice to murder. Lantier, despite having witnessed them quite clearly in the train corridor, hides the fact during the investigation as he is attracted to S\u00e9verine. They both begin an affair, all the while Roubaud becomes increasingly withdrawn and starts to gamble.
