After several years spent studying medicine in Germany, he finds the country of his youth replaced by turmoil. His dream of using his craft to improve the health of Ethiopians is squashed by a military junta that uses scientists for its own political ends. Seeking the comfort of his countryside home, Anberber finds no refuge from violence. The solace that the memories of his youth provide is quickly replaced by the competing forces of military and rebelling factions. Anberber needs to decide whether he wants to bear the strain or piece together a life from the fragments that lie around him.", "Language": "Amharic, English, German", "Country": "Ethiopia, Germany, France", "Awards": "8 wins & 3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzU2NzQtZWYxNi00NTY4LWFhODItN2ExZmY5MDhiZWQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDk1ODM3MA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "78", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "476", "imdbID": "tt1284592", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.1/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "88%", "MetacriticRating": "78/100"}
