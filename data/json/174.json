The madam essentially owns the women: their expenses exceed earnings, they are in debt. They face problems of pregnancy, opium, age, and violent clients. One reads sociology at her peril. Occasionally, a client talks of marriage. There are also friendships and affection among the women. The madam is in a dispute with her landlord and calls on influential clients to help. There's a picnic one summer day, a wake, and an evening in masks. Have they expectations? In a coda, we watch a street scene in contemporary Paris.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "4 wins & 15 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTMzMDgwYWYtNjNiMy00OWYzLWI4M2QtNjg3YzYwMzc4MTliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ2MTk1OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "75", "imdbRating": "6.7", "imdbVotes": "5,830", "imdbID": "tt1660379", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "13 Mar 2012", "BoxOffice": "$19,327", "Production": "Independent Pictures", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.7/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "83%", "MetacriticRating": "75/100"}
