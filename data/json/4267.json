Persuaded by Tom, the town agree to hide Grace, and in return she freely helps the locals. However, when the Sheriff from a neighbouring town posts a Missing notice, advertising a reward for revealing her whereabouts, the townsfolk require a better deal from Grace, in return for their silence; and when the Sheriff returns some weeks later with a Wanted poster, even though the citizens know her to be innocent of the false charges against her, the town's sense of goodness takes a sinister turn and the price of Grace's freedom becomes a workload and treatment akin to that of a slave. But Grace has a deadly secret that the townsfolk will eventually encounter.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, UK, France, Finland, Norway, Italy", "Awards": "21 wins & 31 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNTg2MTI1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM1MzUyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "60", "imdbRating": "8.0", "imdbVotes": "130,450", "imdbID": "tt0276919", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "24 Aug 2004", "BoxOffice": "$1,498,177", "Production": "Lions Gate Films", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "8.0/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "70%", "MetacriticRating": "60/100"}
