Through his trek, Eric, most taking place in his stretch limousine, meets with several business associates - some with as esoteric job titles as Head of Theory - and personal acquaintances, including his several week bride, Elise, a wealthy woman in her own right with who he still has a somewhat distant relationship if only because they don't really know each other. The start of Eric's day ends much differently than the end as his personal fortune largely hinges on external forces in relation to a speculative currency transaction, and as he learns that someone is trying to kill him, who and for what reason he does not know.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Canada, France, Portugal, Italy", "Awards": "3 wins & 13 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjI0MDYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIzMDEyOA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "58", "imdbRating": "5.0", "imdbVotes": "42,902", "imdbID": "tt1480656", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "01 Jan 2013", "BoxOffice": "$600,000", "Production": "Entertainment One", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "5.0/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "65%", "MetacriticRating": "58/100"}
