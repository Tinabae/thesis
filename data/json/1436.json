A garden. A terrace. A woman and a man sit at a table beneath the trees, with a soft summer wind. In the distance, in the vast plain, the silhouette of Paris. A conversation begins: questions and answers between the woman and the man. It deals with sexual experiences, childhood, memories, the essence of summer and the difference between men and women. It illustrates both, feminine perspective and masculine perception. In the background, inside the house that opens onto the terrace, on the woman and the man: the writer, in the process of imagining this dialogue and typing it down. Or is it the other way around? Might it be that those two characters over there tell him what he's putting down on paper: a long, final dialogue between a man and a woman?", "Language": "French, German, English", "Country": "France, Germany, Portugal", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTY3ZGE4NDQtMDdhNS00MTI2LWE4MDctZjU5OWJlNjczYWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "32", "imdbRating": "4.6", "imdbVotes": "492", "imdbID": "tt4715652", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "4.6/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "30%", "MetacriticRating": "32/100"}
