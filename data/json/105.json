Crime is rife, especially drugs and drug violence. A Russian thug is building his heroin trade, while everyone laughs at the cops. Brothers have chosen different paths: Joe has followed his father Bert into New York's Finest; he's a rising star. Bobby, who uses his mother's maiden name, manages a club. Bobby too is on the rise: he has a new girlfriend and a green-light to develop a Manhattan club. Joe and Bert ask him to help with intelligence gathering; he declines. Then, Joe raids Bobby's club to arrest the Russian. From there, things spiral out of control: the Russian puts out a hit on Joe, personal losses mount, and Bobby's loyalties face the test.", "Language": "English, Russian, Spanish", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "1 win & 5 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTQ5OTcyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE0NzUzMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "59", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "82,005", "imdbID": "tt0498399", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "13 Feb 2008", "BoxOffice": "$27,600,000", "Production": "Sony/Columbia", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "6.8/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "57%", "MetacriticRating": "59/100"}
