A model family! They are few, those that could match them. The father? A dignified man, (honest) storekeeper by trade, who cares about his five children, going as far as to supervise the homework of his youngest daughter. The mother? Both a dedicated teacher and a regular Martha Stewart. The children? Well-educated and promised to a bright future. Alejandro, for one, is already an admired rugby star. Except that... all this respectability is nothing but a smokescreen! The truth is that Arquimedes Puccio is also - and mainly - the tyrannical leader of a criminal gang composed of... his wife and children. Puccio's undercover activities ? Well, they consist in kidnapping rich people (preferably young), detaining them in his own house, torturing them gratuitously and doing away with them after cashing the ransom. The Puccios, a model family? Yes, but a model evil family!", "Language": "Spanish", "Country": "Argentina, Spain", "Awards": "14 wins & 36 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODMwMjg5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTE2NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "73", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "11,013", "imdbID": "tt4411504", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.0/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "N/A", "MetacriticRating": "73/100"}
